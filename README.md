# Outer Wilds Flyover
Recreation of the Island Flyover game from Wii Sports Resort in Outer Wilds.

## About this mod
80 i-points are placed in various locations in the base game. Try to collect them all! Some are in very obvious locations, while others are hidden away in less well-known areas. None are placed in locations related to the DLC.

The i-points that you've already found are saved, and a results screen appears when you die that shows your collected i-points. Currently there are no rewards, but I'd like to add them in later.

This mod is intended for players who have completed the game and wish they could replay the game again.
I've tried to keep the descriptions of the i-points as spoiler-free as possible, but it's still recommended to finish the game first before installing the mod.

### The original game
Island Flyover was a small game inside of Wii Sports Resort in which the player would fly their plane around an island trying to collect 80 i-points. The player was given a reward every 10 i-points, such as being able to shoot balloons or being able to fly at night.
